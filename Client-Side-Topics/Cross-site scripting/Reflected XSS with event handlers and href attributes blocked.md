## Reflected XSS with event handlers and href attributes blocked

### Objective:
- This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability with some whitelisted tags, but all events and anchor `href` attributes are blocked.
- To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects a vector that, when clicked, calls the `alert` function.
- Note that you need to label your vector with the word "Click" in order to induce the simulated lab user to click your vector. For example:
```html
<a href="">Click me</a>`
```
